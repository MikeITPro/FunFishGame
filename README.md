When the game is started, players are welcomed by an artistically pleasing main menu screen. Here, the user is given two main choices, each serving a distinct purpose.
<br />
<b>Setting button (gear icon)</b>: The settings screen is displayed, where the user can configure music and sound.
<br />
<b>Play button</b>: Ready for adventure? The "Play" buttons beckon, accompanied by an exhilarating audio signal. A single tap exports the player to the next page, where levels of the game will be present for the player to select.
<br />
